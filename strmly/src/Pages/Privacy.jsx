        This Privacy Policy describes how and when Blulio uses and collects your
        data, checks your information and shares with other Services.
        <br />
        Information Collection and Use Basic Account Information
        <br />
        Upon creation of a blulio account, some personal information such as
        your username, password, and email address is collected and stored
        internally. Browsing other areas of the service does not require
        registration or the providing of any further information. Public
        information like a short description, a profile picture, cover picture,
        and display name, can be provided after registration. This information
        is viewable by any visitor of the site, registered or unregistered, and
        therefore should not contain any critical information about you or
        someone else.
        <br />
        Posting Our Service primarily is designed to post content you desire to
        benefit from financially. Visibility of posts is determined by your
        subscription selections. This information does not include the profiles
        you make and other bits of information that result from using our
        Service.
        <br />
        Non-personal Identification Information When using our Services, we may
        receive technical information ("Non-personal Identification")
        information such as your IP address, operating system, pages visited,
        and locale. We receive this data when you interact with our Services,
        for example, when you sign into our Services.
        <br />
        Information Sharing blulio will keep any collected data (see
        "Information Collection and Use" above) on our servers. Any information
        shared with other Services is controlled by the user itself, as we only
        supply sharing to these. If a user isn't satisfied with Terms from
        another Service they shouldn't connect their accounts or remove access
        over the Sharing page on the profile settings page. Notwithstanding
        anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose
        your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply
        with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any
        person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect
        blulio's rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is
        intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to
        a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your
        information.
        <br />
        Modifying Your Personal Information If you are a registered user of our
        Services, we provide you with tools and account settings to access or
        modify the personal information you provided to us and associated with
        your account.
        <br />
        Our Policy Towards Children Our Services are not directed to persons
        under 16. If you become aware that your child has provided us with
        personal information without your consent, contact us at
        support@blulio.com . We do not knowingly collect personal information
        from children under 16. If we become aware that a child under 16 has
        provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove such
        information and terminate the child's account.
